description: 'It has been awhile since I have been able to write-my sincere apologies. I have traveled non-stop for work in what felt like 15 simultaneous directions at once. I have now departed the cold and snowy existence of Washington DC, only to arrive in the warmth and clear blue skies of Costa Rica.'
